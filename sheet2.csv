contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/Chain-of-Legends/contracts,https://github.com/Chain-of-Legends/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

- The repository contains concrete BSC-specific configuration and addresses in actual implementation code (index.js). This is not limited to README mentions — the code itself references BSC chain id, BSC scan links, and hard-coded contract addresses. Specifically:
  - index.js includes axios request URLs with query parameter `chainid=56` (BSC mainnet chain id) when calling the Etherscan-like API.
  - The code expects a BSCSCAN API key via env var `BSCSCAN_API_KEY` and the token contract address via `CGPT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
  - The implementation hardcodes multiple 0x... contract addresses in a `contractAddresses` array and tags them with `chain: 'BSC'`.
  - The code generates bscscan.com links (e.g. `https://bscscan.com/token/${cgptContractAddress}?a=${address}`), indicating the runtime behavior targets BSC mainnet explorers.

- The repository contains concrete implementation-code evidence that it interacts with BSC mainnet (BNB Chain). This evidence is present in index.js (implementation file) and includes: hard-coded 0x... contract addresses in a contractAddresses array, use of the BscScan API endpoints (https://api.bscscan.com), and generation of bscscan.com links for token/account lookups. These items are in actual runtime code (index.js), not just README or docs, and therefore satisfy the requirement for concrete BSC deployment evidence per the provided criteria.

- There is no full node / RPC configuration or chainId (56) present, and no hardhat/truffle deployment scripts or verification metadata in the repository. However, the presence of many explicit contract addresses and direct use of api.bscscan.com in implementation code is sufficient under the stated criteria (""Contract addresses with BSC mainnet context in actual code"" and ""BSC mainnet RPC URLs or endpoints configured in implementation files"").

Conclusion: The project is implemented to operate against BSC (via BscScan) and contains BSC contract addresses in implementation code — so mark as deployed on BSC according to the repository evidence requirements.

If you require a stricter interpretation that demands chainId:56 or RPC endpoints instead of BscScan API usage, note that those are not present and the result would be different.

Evidence in implementation files (not README) includes:

- The code calls the BscScan mainnet API endpoints (https://api.bscscan.com/...) to fetch token supply and token balances. These are BSC mainnet API endpoints, present in index.js (functions getTotalSupply() and various endpoints use `https://api.bscscan.com/api?module=...`).
- The application constructs links to the BscScan mainnet explorer (https://bscscan.com/token/...) when presenting addresses in the UI (in index.js). This demonstrates the code is querying and referencing BSC mainnet explorer URLs.
- The implementation contains a hard-coded array of many 0x... contract addresses in index.js (contractAddresses array) with the chain field set to 'BSC'. These addresses are present in the runtime implementation, not only in documentation.
- The app expects a BSCSCAN_API_KEY environment variable (process.env.BSCSCAN_API_KEY) and a contract address environment variable (CGPT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS), which it uses to call BscScan mainnet endpoints.

Per the project's CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence of interaction with BSC mainnet in implementation code (index.js).

- Hardhat network configuration explicitly defines a `bsc` network with chainId 56 and a BSC RPC URL (`https://binance.llamarpc.com`) in hardhat.config.ts.
- deploy-config.ts contains a branch for ['bsc', 'bsc-fork'] that returns BSC-specific configuration: WBNB address, factories, stable tokens, Chainlink oracle addresses (Chainlink BNB/USD, BUSD/USD, USDC/USD, USDT/USD), and a proxy admin address.
- Multiple deployment artifact files (deployments/*.json) contain entries named `*-bsc-deployment.json` with deployed contract addresses and verification commands using `--network bsc`. These are concrete deployment records in the repository (e.g. addresses and npx hardhat verify commands referencing network `bsc`).
- Tests and fixtures (test/fixtures/deployPriceGetter.ts and test/PriceGetter.spec.ts) use BSC addresses (WBNB, BUSD, USDC, USDT, Chainlink oracles) and a BSC-oriented fixture name (`deployPriceGetterBSCFixture`).
- Deployment scripts (scripts/deploy/deployPriceGetter.ts and scripts/deploy/deployPriceGetterProtocols.ts and DeployManager) produce and verify deployments and include generation of verification commands for `--network bsc`.

- truffle-config.js contains an explicit network entry named ""bsc"" with network_id: 56 and a BSC RPC endpoint (`https://bscrpc.com`). This is direct network configuration targeting BSC mainnet.
- migration-config.js includes a `bsc` branch that returns numerous BSC mainnet contract addresses (factory, router, WBNB, feeAddress, liquidityHelper, multicall). Those addresses are hard-coded in an implementation file used by migrations.
- ApeOnlyPriceGetterBSC.sol (Solidity implementation) hard-codes ApeSwap BSC mainnet addresses (FACTORY, WNATIVE (WBNB), BUSD, USDC, DAI, USDT and BSC LP pair addresses). That is concrete on-chain address data embedded in an implementation contract.
- scripts/queryLPTokens.ts uses a BSC mainnet RPC provider URL (`https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org`) and calls getNetworkConfig('bsc') to obtain factory & multicall addresses. This is an implementation script that queries live BSC data.
- package.json contains npm scripts specifically for BSC: `migrate:bsc`, `verify:bsc`, `verify:bsc:liq-helper`. truffle-config.js also includes API key mapping for `bscscan` (process.env.BSCSCAN_API_KEY) and the project uses `truffle-plugin-verify`, indicating verification tooling configured for BSC.

- subgraph.yaml (configuration) explicitly sets network: bsc and a Factory contract address with a startBlock. This is a deployment/config target, not just README text.
- src/mappings/helpers.ts contains a FACTORY_ADDRESS constant set to 0x0841BD0B734E4F5853f0dD8d7Ea041c241fb0Da6 and binds a FactoryContract to that address in code.
- src/mappings/pricing.ts contains WBNB and multiple specific pair addresses (BUSD_WBNB_PAIR, DAI_WBNB_PAIR, USDT_WBNB_PAIR) and a WHITELIST of token addresses (many of which are BSC mainnet token addresses such as WBNB, BUSD, USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.). These are in implementation code and used by the subgraph mappings.

Per the project requirements, README mentions alone are insufficient. However, because implementation files and configuration files contain explicit BSC network and BSC contract addresses used by the code, this satisfies the ""CONCRETE EVIDENCE"" requirement that the project targets BSC/BNB Chain.

#NAME?,bnb-chain,https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/-apeswap-yields,https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/-apeswap-yields,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete evidence of BSC (BNB Chain) deployment is present in the repository implementation/config files. The config/pools.json file includes numerous contract addresses and token addresses keyed under the network id ""56"" (BSC mainnet). The file also uses BEP20/BEP-specific ABIs (e.g. ""BEP20_REWARD_APE_ABI"") and contains known BSC mainnet token addresses (for example BANANA and WBNB), which demonstrates that these contracts are intended to be used on chain id 56. This is implementation/configuration-level evidence (not README/documentation), which satisfies the project's requirement for concrete deployment evidence in code/config.

Specific findings

- config/pools.json contains multiple objects with stakingToken.address, rewardToken.address and contractAddress entries mapped by the numeric key ""56"". The numeric key 56 corresponds to BSC mainnet chain id. These are configuration files used by implementation (frontend/backend) to interact with on-chain contracts.
- Known BSC addresses appear in the file, notably:
  - BANANA token: 0x603c7f932ED1fc6575303D8Fb018fDCBb0f39a95 (listed under stakingToken.address for network 56)
  - WBNB (wrapped BNB): 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c (listed as rewardToken.address for network 56 in sousId 1)
- Multiple contractAddress entries include '56' keys pointing at 0x... addresses (examples given below). These are concrete contract addresses configured in code (not only in README).
- The file explicitly references ABIs named with BEP20 (BEP20_REWARD_APE_ABI), indicating BSC/BEP20 usage.

Because this evidence resides in an implementation/configuration file (config/pools.json), and contains multiple BSC mainnet addresses keyed under chain id 56, the repository contains concrete evidence of deployment/targeting of BSC mainnet.

Caveats & missing items

- There are no hardhat/truffle config files, deployment scripts, or RPC URLs present in the analyzed files. The repository does not include direct transaction hashes or verification artifacts. BscScan verification status or other on-chain verification metadata is not included in the repo.

apeswap-golden-banana,bnb-chain,https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/apeswap-golden-banana,https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/apeswap-golden-banana,TRUE,"## Conclusion

Concrete BSC deployment configuration and BSC mainnet addresses are present in implementation code (not only README). Multiple implementation and configuration files explicitly target BSC mainnet (chain id 56) and include BSC RPC endpoints and mainnet contract addresses. This satisfies the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT that evidence must come from implementation/config/deployment code.

Key concrete findings (implementation files):

- truffle-config.js defines a ""bsc"" network with provider RPC pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org and network_id: 56. It also defines a ""bsc-testnet"" network using https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org and network_id: 97. This is a direct configuration for deploying to BSC mainnet.
- deploy.config.js contains BSC MAINNET configuration with an explicit BANANA token mainnet address (0x603c7f932ED1fc6575303D8Fb018fDCBb0f39a95) and an admin address for mainnet.
- scripts/queryGnanaTotalBurns.ts and scripts/encode-transfer-ownership.ts reference BSC-specific addresses and use a BSC Etherscan configuration (getConfig('bsc')). encode-transfer-ownership.ts uses mainnet TREASURY, TIMELOCK and NEW_OWNER addresses in code.
- package.json includes truffle scripts for migrating/verifying to bsc and bsc-testnet (e.g. ""migrate:bsc-testnet"", ""verify:bsc-testnet"") and lists truffle-plugin-verify and truffle providers in dependencies/devDependencies.
- migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js uses the getNetworkConfig(network, accounts) mechanism (deploy.config.js) so the migrations are prepared to deploy to networks including BSC.

Because these are found in implementation/config/deployment files (truffle-config.js, deploy.config.js, migration scripts, TypeScript scripts), this repository contains concrete evidence prepared for BSC mainnet deployment.

## Notes on verification

The repository includes tooling to verify contracts on BscScan (truffle-plugin-verify and an API key variable BSCSCAN_API_KEY referenced in truffle-config.js). However, the presence of verification tooling does not on its own prove contracts were verified on BscScan; it only demonstrates the project is configured for verification.

Overall: evidence in implementation files shows this project is intended and configured to be deployed on BSC mainnet. The required implementation-level evidence (chain ID 56, BSC RPC, mainnet addresses, deployment scripts) is present.

tokens,bnb-chain,https://github.com/tonj5554/tokens,https://github.com/tonj5554/tokens,TRUE,"## Findings

I found concrete BSC mainnet deployment evidence inside implementation files in the repository. Specifically, there are token metadata files under the `bsc/` directory that include BSC contract addresses (0x... format) and bscscan explorer URLs. These are not README-only mentions — they exist as implementation/data files (.js and .sol) within the code tree and include explicit BEP20 type and bscscan links. 

What I did NOT find: there are no hardhat/truffle network configs, no RPC endpoints, no deployment scripts or transaction hashes in the analyzed files. However, the presence of explicit 0x addresses and bscscan explorer links in implementation files meets the criterion of ""BSC contract addresses in implementation files"" required for concrete evidence.

Concrete items found (examples):
- bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol contains id/address `0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365`, type `BEP20`.
- bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js contains id/address `0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b`, type `BEP20`.

Conclusion: There is concrete implementation-level evidence (contract addresses and bscscan links) indicating these tokens are deployed on BSC mainnet. Therefore I mark the repository as having BSC deployment evidence in implementation files.

Caveat: The repository does not include deployment scripts, network configs (e.g., chainId=56 in hardhat/truffle config), RPC endpoints, or verification artifacts — only token metadata files that reference BSC addresses and bscscan.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/magpiexyz/contracts,https://github.com/magpiexyz/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

tokens,bnb-chain,https://github.com/catecoins/tokens,https://github.com/catecoins/tokens,TRUE,"## Findings

I found concrete BSC mainnet deployment evidence inside implementation files in the repository. Specifically, there are token metadata files under the `bsc/` directory that include BSC contract addresses (0x... format) and bscscan explorer URLs. These are not README-only mentions — they exist as implementation/data files (.js and .sol) within the code tree and include explicit BEP20 type and bscscan links. 

What I did NOT find: there are no hardhat/truffle network configs, no RPC endpoints, no deployment scripts or transaction hashes in the analyzed files. However, the presence of explicit 0x addresses and bscscan explorer links in implementation files meets the criterion of ""BSC contract addresses in implementation files"" required for concrete evidence.

Concrete items found (examples):
- bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol contains id/address `0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365`, type `BEP20`.
- bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js contains id/address `0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b`, type `BEP20`.

Conclusion: There is concrete implementation-level evidence (contract addresses and bscscan links) indicating these tokens are deployed on BSC mainnet. Therefore I mark the repository as having BSC deployment evidence in implementation files.

Caveat: The repository does not include deployment scripts, network configs (e.g., chainId=56 in hardhat/truffle config), RPC endpoints, or verification artifacts — only token metadata files that reference BSC addresses and bscscan. These metadata files are nonetheless implementation files containing concrete BSC addresses and so satisfy the critical requirement that evidence be in implementation files (not README/documentation only).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol — contains id/address 0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, type BEP20', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js — contains id/address 0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, type BEP20'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md and numerous chain-specific README files (e.g., solana/README.md, arbitrum/README.md, etc.) — these are documentation and were ignored per criteria', 'General repository README mentions of many chains — ignored because documentation-only', 'No hardhat/truffle configs or RPC endpoints discovered in provided files — absence noted but not treated as evidence'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js', 'README.md', 'zeta/README.md', 'iost/README.md', 'kcc/Readme.md', 'solana/README.md', 'meta_20028/README.md', 'optimistic/README.md', 'xlayer/README.md', 'klaytn/README.md', 'bty_2999/README.md', 'bttc/README.md', 'FON_201022/README.md', 'zksync/README.md', 'blast/README.md', 'NFT/README.md', 'lat/Readme.md', 'fantom/README.md', 'scroll/README.md', 'fil/README.md', 'eos-evm/README.md', 'Avalanche-C/README.md', 'arbitrum/README.md'], 'contract_structure': 'The referenced files are token metadata records (JSON-like content) describing BEP20 tokens (name, symbol, decimals, status, id/address) and providing bscscan explorer URLs.

- The solidity implementation (cat.sol) contains a hard-coded address for the PancakeSwap v2 router: 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E. This exact address is the well-known PancakeSwap Router v2 contract on BSC mainnet. The constructor casts that address to IUniswapV2Router02 and uses it to create a pair and to call router functions (WETH(), factory(), swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens, addLiquidityETH, etc.).

- The code therefore explicitly targets PancakeSwap (the primary DEX on BSC mainnet) by hardcoding its mainnet router address and integrating with it in the constructor and swap/add-liquidity routines. This is concrete implementation-level evidence that the contract is intended to operate on BSC mainnet.

- Additional supporting evidence in the implementation file: top-of-file comment ""Submitted for verification at BscScan.com on 2021-07-04"" which indicates the source was submitted for verification on the BSC block explorer. While a comment alone would be insufficient, combined with the hard-coded PancakeSwap router address it strengthens the conclusion that this contract was deployed/verified on BSC.

Conclusion

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/buzz0283/contracts,https://github.com/buzz0283/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/eesee-io/contracts,https://github.com/eesee-io/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

ethereum-etl,bnb-chain,https://github.com/dex-guru/ethereum-etl,https://github.com/dex-guru/ethereum-etl,TRUE,"Findings summary

- I found concrete implementation/configuration evidence in the repository that references BSC mainnet (chain id 56) with real BSC contract addresses inside configuration/metadata files (JSON) used by the indexer. These JSON files are part of the implementation (not README/docs) and map deployed contracts to chain IDs (folder name 56). That satisfies the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT that evidence must exist in implementation/config files.

What I checked

- Searched implementation and configuration files in the repository (not README files) for BSC-specific evidence (chain id 56, BSC addresses / deployments, RPC endpoints, deployment scripts targeting BSC). The concrete evidence comes from the ethereumetl service deploy metadata files (JSON) under ethereumetl/service/dex/*/deploys/56/*. These files contain known BSC contract addresses (e.g. PancakeSwap router/factory addresses and others) and are used by the indexer implementation.

Why this is sufficient

- The criteria requires concrete evidence in implementation/config/deployment code. The metadata JSON files are implementation configuration files that explicitly list contract addresses for chain 56. They are not README mentions — they are machine-readable configuration used at runtime by the indexer to know which contracts to index for specific networks. Therefore this counts as concrete evidence that the project is configured to operate on BSC (chain id 56) and includes BSC contract addresses.

What I did NOT rely on

- I did NOT count README text or documentation mentions as evidence (these exist but are insufficient per your rules). I also did not find any hardhat/truffle network configuration files explicitly naming chain id 56 or BSC RPC endpoints; however, the presence of configuration metadata with chain-id-specific directories and BSC addresses is enough per your criteria (contract addresses in configuration files).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['ethereumetl/service/dex/uniswap_v2/deploys/56/metadata.json — contains BSC PancakeSwap addresses (e.g. UniswapV2Router: 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E, UniswapV2Factory: 0xcA143Ce32Fe78f1f7019d7d551a6402fC5350c73).', 'ethereumetl/service/dex/uniswap_v2/deploys/56/metadata.json — contains many other BSC DEX addresses (pancakeswap_v1 Router/Factory, apeswap router/factory, biswap factory, etc.).', 'ethereumetl/service/dex/wombat/deploys/56/metadata.json — contains a Wombat MasterWombat contract address: 0x489833311676B566f888119c29bd997Dc6C95830.', 'Directory naming convention: deploys/56 indicates configuration for chain id 56 (BSC mainnet).

charting-lib-wss-custom-study,bnb-chain,https://github.com/dex-guru/charting-lib-wss-custom-study,https://github.com/dex-guru/charting-lib-wss-custom-study,TRUE,"Concrete BSC-specific implementation evidence was found in the repository implementation files (not README). Specifically:

- src/components/TVChartContainer/datafeed/helper.ts contains an explicit chainId = 56 constant used when building streaming channel IDs (56 is BSC mainnet chain id). This is a direct, implementation-level reference to BSC mainnet.
- src/App.tsx sets the example chart symbol to a token ticker that embeds a BSC token address and the ""-bsc_USD"" network suffix (symbolName = ""0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c-bsc_USD""). The address 0xbb4cdb9cb... is the canonical WBNB token address on BSC. That is a concrete contract address present in implementation code.
- The buildChannelKey implementation uses the token address, a parsed network suffix like ""bsc"", and the hardcoded chainId 56 to produce a streaming channel identifier (RoundedCandle.id-...-56-...). This demonstrates the application is configured at the implementation level to construct BSC-mainnet channel keys and interact with BSC-context data.

No README or documentation was used to reach this conclusion; the above evidence is present inside TypeScript implementation files.

Note: This repository contains frontend/datafeed code and not smart-contract deployment scripts. There are no hardhat/truffle deployment scripts, BSC RPC endpoints, migration scripts, or BscScan verification files included.

marketplacegraph,bnb-chain,https://github.com/farcana/marketplacegraph,https://github.com/farcana/marketplacegraph,TRUE,"Findings

- I found concrete, implementation-level configuration that targets BSC (BNB Chain) inside the repository configuration files used by the subgraph implementation. Specifically:
  - marketplacegraph/networks.json contains a top-level key ""bsc"" with a concrete contract address (0x0eBF17832B9C26a538d4C66854306f5126a100c2).
  - marketplacegraph/subgraph.yaml explicitly sets the dataSource network to ""bsc"" and the source.address in that dataSource to the same 0x0eBF... address.

Why this meets the criteria

- The CRITICAL REQUIREMENT states that evidence in implementation/configuration files is required. networks.json and subgraph.yaml are implementation/configuration files (not README or docs) and they explicitly configure the network as ""bsc"" and provide a concrete 0x... contract address. The criteria list explicitly allows contract addresses in configuration files as valid concrete evidence of BSC deployment.

Notes about other files

- There are ABIs and mapping handlers (TypeScript) implementing event handlers for an ERC721 marketplace contract. The mapping file (src/erc-721-nft-market-v-1.ts) and schema.graphql implement The Graph subgraph logic for that contract. The subgraph configuration ties those implementation files to the BSC network and the specific contract address, which is direct implementation-level evidence that the subgraph is configured to watch a contract deployed on BSC.

tokens,bnb-chain,https://github.com/RETOKENofficial/tokens,https://github.com/RETOKENofficial/tokens,TRUE,"## Findings

I found concrete BSC mainnet deployment evidence inside implementation files in the repository. Specifically, there are token metadata files under the `bsc/` directory that include BSC contract addresses (0x... format) and bscscan explorer URLs. These are not README-only mentions — they exist as implementation/data files (.js and .sol) within the code tree and include explicit BEP20 type and bscscan links. 

What I did NOT find: there are no hardhat/truffle network configs, no RPC endpoints, no deployment scripts or transaction hashes in the analyzed files. However, the presence of explicit 0x addresses and bscscan explorer links in implementation files meets the criterion of ""BSC contract addresses in implementation files"" required for concrete evidence.

Concrete items found (examples):
- bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol contains id/address `0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365`, type `BEP20`.
- bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js contains id/address `0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b`, type `BEP20`.

Conclusion: There is concrete implementation-level evidence (contract addresses and bscscan links) indicating these tokens are deployed on BSC mainnet. Therefore I mark the repository as having BSC deployment evidence in implementation files.

Caveat: The repository does not include deployment scripts, network configs (e.g., chainId=56 in hardhat/truffle config), RPC endpoints, or verification artifacts — only token metadata files that reference BSC addresses and bscscan.

Bink-Telegram,bnb-chain,https://github.com/Bink-AI/Bink-Telegram,https://github.com/Bink-AI/Bink-Telegram,TRUE,"Summary

- I found concrete implementation-code evidence that this project is configured to target BNB Chain (BSC mainnet): the code explicitly sets chainId: 56 and references a BSC RPC URL environment variable in a TypeScript implementation file (src/modules/telegram-bot/handlers/user-input.handler.ts). This qualifies as concrete implementation evidence per the criteria (explicit Chain ID 56 and RPC configuration in implementation code).

Detailed findings

- The decisive evidence is in implementation code (not README or docs). The UserInputHandler constructs a NetworksConfig with an entry keyed 'bnb' that includes:
  - chainId: 56 (BSC mainnet chain id)
  - rpcUrl: process.env.BSC_RPC_URL (explicit BSC RPC environment variable referenced)
  - name: 'BNB Chain'

  This demonstrates the application has an actual runtime network configuration targeting BNB Chain/BSC mainnet.

- Additional supporting evidence (also in implementation/config files): package.json includes dependencies and providers for BSC ecosystem protocols (e.g., @pancakeswap/sdk, @binkai/pancakeswap-provider, @binkai/venus-provider) which indicates intent to interact with PancakeSwap/Venus on BSC. These are supportive but the primary concrete evidence remains the chainId: 56 and BSC RPC env var reference in implementation code.

Why this meets the required criteria

- The criteria state Chain ID 56 or BSC RPC URLs in implementation files count as valid, concrete evidence. The project contains chainId: 56 and references an implementation environment variable BSC_RPC_URL inside TypeScript code used at runtime to configure the network — this is implementation code evidence, not documentation only.

Caveats

- There are no BSC contract addresses, deployment scripts, or transaction hashes found in the repository. There is no explicit deploy script targeting BSC mainnet. However the presence of chainId 56 and BSC RPC configuration in implementation code is sufficient per the provided acceptance criteria to conclude the project is configured to operate on BSC (BNB Chain).

Conclusion

- src/actions/executeTransaction.ts creates many BSC-specific providers (PancakeSwapProvider, FourMemeProvider, VenusProvider, OkuProvider, KyberProvider, ThenaProvider) passing the BSC JsonRpcProvider and bscChainId = 56.

Per the stated criteria, presence of chain ID 56 and BSC mainnet RPC endpoints in implementation files counts as concrete deployment evidence. No explicit deployed contract addresses or tx hashes were found in code, and there is no evidence of verified contract addresses, but the network-level configuration and BSC-targeted provider initializations satisfy the requirement for concrete BSC deployment evidence in implementation code.

Therefore I mark is_deployed_on_bsc = true because implementation code concretely configures and targets BSC mainnet (chain id 56) and BSC mainnet RPC endpoints.

web3-domain-resolver,bnb-chain,https://github.com/FreenameDomains/web3-domain-resolver,https://github.com/FreenameDomains/web3-domain-resolver,TRUE,"Summary of findings

- I found concrete, implementation-level evidence in TypeScript source files that this library is configured to interact with BSC mainnet: (1) a BSC RPC endpoint is present in the default connections constant, and (2) a Freename contract address is explicitly configured for NetworkName.BSC in the Freename contract configuration array. Both are in implementation code (not README). The code also contains logic that uses those connection entries to create ethers JsonRpcProviders and Contract instances, showing these BSC entries are meant to be used at runtime.

Files & concrete facts (high level):
- src/defaults/default-connections.ts defines DEFAULT_RPC_URL.bsc = ""https://bsc-dataseed1.ninicoin.io"" (implementation code, a BSC mainnet RPC URL).
- src/resolver-providers/providers/freename/freename-resolver-provider.consts.ts contains FREENAME_CONTRACT_CONFS entries with networkName: NetworkName.BSC and address: ""0x465ea4967479A96D4490d575b5a6cC2B4A4BEE65"" (read and write), which is an explicit contract address for BSC in implementation code.
- The ContractConnection implementation (src/networks/connections/contract-connection.ts) creates an ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(connection.rpcUrl) and new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider). That demonstrates how the BSC RPC URL and the BSC contract address are actually used to create contract objects at runtime.

Conclusion

Because there is concrete implementation evidence (BSC RPC URL in defaults and BSC contract address in Freename contract config) and the code constructs providers/contracts using those configuration values, the repository contains implementation-level configuration that targets BSC mainnet.

watchmarket,bnb-chain,https://github.com/pitbullBSC/watchmarket,https://github.com/pitbullBSC/watchmarket,TRUE,"Findings summary

- I inspected the implementation code (Go sources and configuration) and found concrete BSC-related contract addresses embedded in implementation code (not just README). These addresses correspond to well-known tokens on Binance Smart Chain (for example WBNB, BTCB, BSC-USDT). The addresses are present in services/markets/coinmarketcap/mapping.go which is part of the provider implementation (used at runtime). Embedding mainnet token contract addresses in code/config is considered concrete evidence per the criteria.

- I did NOT find explicit network configuration entries such as a chain ID = 56, BSC RPC URLs, hardhat/truffle config, or deployment scripts that explicitly mention BSC mainnet. Those items are absent. However, the mapping contains BSC mainnet token contract addresses (0x... values) in implementation code which satisfies the criteria allowing contract addresses in implementation files as evidence of BSC usage.

Specific evidence (high level):
- services/markets/coinmarketcap/mapping.go includes explicit 0x... token addresses known to be BSC mainnet token contracts (examples: WBNB, BTCB, USDT on BSC). These are in a JSON mapping constant used by the CoinMarketCap provider code.

Caveats

- There is no explicit chain id (56) nor RPC endpoint or deployment script (hardhat/truffle/etc.) that directly sets or calls BSC mainnet in the repository. If you require chain-ID or RPC presence (chain config files) in addition to addresses, that is not present.

tokens,bnb-chain,https://github.com/pitbullBSC/tokens,https://github.com/pitbullBSC/tokens,TRUE,"## Findings

I found concrete BSC mainnet deployment evidence inside implementation files in the repository. Specifically, there are token metadata files under the `bsc/` directory that include BSC contract addresses (0x... format) and bscscan explorer URLs. These are not README-only mentions — they exist as implementation/data files (.js and .sol) within the code tree and include explicit BEP20 type and bscscan links. 

What I did NOT find: there are no hardhat/truffle network configs, no RPC endpoints, no deployment scripts or transaction hashes in the analyzed files. However, the presence of explicit 0x addresses and bscscan explorer links in implementation files meets the criterion of ""BSC contract addresses in implementation files"" required for concrete evidence.

Conclusion: There is concrete implementation-level evidence (contract addresses and bscscan links) indicating these tokens are deployed on BSC mainnet. Therefore I mark the repository as having BSC deployment evidence in implementation files.

Caveat: The repository does not include deployment scripts, network configs (e.g., chainId=56 in hardhat/truffle config), RPC endpoints, or verification artifacts — only token metadata files that reference BSC addresses and bscscan. These metadata files are nonetheless implementation files containing concrete BSC addresses and so satisfy the critical requirement that evidence be in implementation files (not README/documentation only).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol — contains id/address 0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, type BEP20', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js — contains id/address 0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, type BEP20'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md and numerous chain-specific README files (e.g., solana/README.md, arbitrum/README.md, etc.) — these are documentation and were ignored per criteria', 'General repository README mentions of many chains — ignored because documentation-only', 'No hardhat/truffle configs or RPC endpoints discovered in provided files — absence noted but not treated as evidence'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js', 'README.md', 'zeta/README.md', 'iost/README.md', 'kcc/Readme.md', 'solana/README.md', 'meta_20028/README.md', 'optimistic/README.md', 'xlayer/README.md', 'klaytn/README.md', 'bty_2999/README.md', 'bttc/README.md', 'FON_201022/README.md', 'zksync/README.md', 'blast/README.md', 'NFT/README.md', 'lat/Readme.md', 'fantom/README.md', 'scroll/README.md', 'fil/README.md', 'eos-evm/README.md', 'Avalanche-C/README.md', 'arbitrum/README.md'], 'contract_structure': 'The referenced files are token metadata records (JSON-like content) describing BEP20 tokens (name, symbol, decimals, status, id/address) and providing bscscan explorer URLs.

Key facts:

- truffle-config.js contains a bscmain network entry with provider pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC endpoint ('https://bsc.nodereal.io') and network_id: 56. That is a direct, concrete configuration targeting BSC mainnet in an implementation/config file.
- The same Truffle config also includes bsctest entry (BSC testnet RPC) and api_keys.bscscan is present, showing BSC verification integration in implementation config.
- Several scripts/tests reference BSC testnet RPC endpoints and include contract addresses labelled as BSC/testnet in implementation code (e.g. test_reputation.js uses a BSC testnet RPC URL).

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/SpaceNationOL/contracts,https://github.com/SpaceNationOL/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

Conclusion: The repository contains concrete implementation-level evidence of BSC mainnet configuration and contract addresses.

datalist,bnb-chain,https://github.com/SynboTech/datalist,https://github.com/SynboTech/datalist,TRUE,"Findings

I inspected the implementation code (JavaScript React components and mock data). There is concrete, in-code evidence that this project includes BSC (BNB Chain) mainnet contract addresses and BSC-specific metadata embedded in implementation files (not just in README or docs). Specifically:

- src/components/LiquidityPools.js (implementation code) contains multiple liquidity pool objects with field chain: 'bsc', chainName: 'BSC', explorerUrl: 'https://bscscan.com' and explicit 0x... contractAddress values (e.g. 0x58F876857a02D6762E0101bb5C46A8c1ED44Dc16).
- src/components/LiquidityPoolDetail.js contains a poolsData object with BSC entries (keys like 'busd-bnb', 'usdt-busd') that include the same BSC contract addresses, token addresses (e.g. BUSD, USDT, BTCB, CAKE), chain: 'bsc', chainName: 'BSC', and explorerUrl pointing to bscscan.

Why this qualifies as concrete implementation evidence

Per the criteria you provided, implementation-code evidence (JS/TS/etc.) is required. The repository includes explicit BSC contract addresses and BSC context (chain field, chainName, explorerUrl) inside application source files (not only README). Those addresses and chain metadata are actual 0x-format addresses and are used in UI components (display, copy, explorer link) — this meets the requirement that contract addresses with BSC mainnet context appear in implementation code.

Limitations / what is NOT present

- There are no smart-contract source files (Solidity) in this repo, and there are no deployment scripts (hardhat.config.js, truffle-config.js, migrations, deploy.js) or network configuration files that explicitly set chainId: 56 or BSC RPC endpoints.
- There is no evidence of the project itself deploying contracts to BSC (no migrations/deploy scripts), and no verification artifacts (no BscScan verification JSON, etc.).

Conclusion

Because explicit BSC mainnet contract addresses and BSC-specific metadata (chain: 'bsc', chainName: 'BSC', explorerUrl 'https://bscscan.com') are present in implementation files (JS components), this repository contains concrete evidence of BSC mainnet deployment references in implementation code. Therefore I mark is_deployed_on_bsc as true, with the caveat that the repo is a front-end/demo using hard-coded BSC addresses (no deployment scripts or network config present).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': [""src/components/LiquidityPools.js — multiple pool entries with chain: 'bsc', chainName: 'BSC', explorerUrl: 'https://bscscan.com' and explicit contractAddress values (e.g. '0x58F876857a02D6762E0101bb5C46A8c1ED44Dc16')."", ""src/components/LiquidityPools.js — token addresses for BSC tokens present in implementation code (e.g. BUSD '0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56', USDT '0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955')."", ""src/components/LiquidityPoolDetail.js — poolsData object includes BSC pools with contractAddress fields and chain: 'bsc', chainName: 'BSC', explorerUrl: 'https://bscscan.com' (e.g. 'busd-bnb' mapping to contractAddress '0x58F876857a02D6762E0101bb5C46A8c1ED44Dc16')."", ""src/components/LiquidityPoolDetail.js — BSC token addresses in poolsData (e.g. BUSD '0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56', USDT '0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955', BTCB '0x7130d2A12B9BCbFAe4f2634d864A1Ee1Ce3Ead9c', CAKE '0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82')."", ""UI behavior uses those addresses to open external links at bscscan (e.g. window.open(`${pool.explorerUrl}/address/${pool.contractAddress}`, '_blank')) — shows BSC explorer usage in code.""], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md mentions BSC/BNB and that the app supports multiple chains — README text is documentation and by itself is insufficient (per provided rules).', 'USAGE.md contains usage instructions and references to multi-chain support — documentation only, not counted as primary evidence.', ""Comments and descriptive strings in components referencing 'BSC' or 'PancakeSwap' without addresses would be insufficient alone — however in this repo the addresses are present in code.""], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['src/components/LiquidityPools.js', 'src/components/LiquidityPoolDetail.js', 'src/components/LiquidityPools.js (duplicate listing is the same file)', 'src/components/Yields.js', 'src/components/ChainDetail.js', 'src/components/Protocols.js', 'src/components/ProjectDetail.js', 'src/components/TokenDetail.js', 'src/data/mockData.js', 'src/App.js', 'package.json', 'README.md', 'USAGE.md'], 'contract_structure': ""No Solidity smart-contract source code or deployment scripts are present in the repository.

Concrete implementation/configuration evidence for BSC (BNB Chain) is present in the repository implementation files. The hardhat config includes an explicit bscMainnet network configuration with a BSC RPC endpoint (https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org) and an etherscan API key entry for BSC. These are implementation-level configuration artifacts (hardhat.config.ts) and satisfy the project's REQUIRED evidence criteria (BSC mainnet RPC URLs or network configuration in implementation files).

Notes:
- The README also claims a deployed contract address on BSC Mainnet, but README content is not sufficient by itself (per the provided criteria). However, because the implementation includes explicit BSC mainnet configuration, the repo contains concrete evidence of targeting/deploying to BSC in implementation files.
- There are no hardcoded BSC contract addresses or chainId = 56 lines inside implementation code; the concrete evidence found is the BSC RPC endpoint and BSC-related etherscan verification key entry in hardhat.config.ts.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/Pheasant-Network/contracts,https://github.com/Pheasant-Network/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/mahaxyz/contracts,https://github.com/mahaxyz/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

veforum,bnb-chain,https://github.com/verisense-network/veforum,https://github.com/verisense-network/veforum,TRUE,"**Summary (short):** The repository contains concrete implementation-level code that targets Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet. Evidence includes an explicit BSC chain id (56), a hard-coded BSC mainnet RPC endpoint (https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org), RPC methods using that endpoint (eth_sendRawTransaction, eth_gasPrice, custom eth_getTransactionDataAndReceipt), and logic to construct, sign (TSS), and send Ethereum-style transactions to chain id 56. This is not just documentation or README text — it is present in multiple Rust implementation files that form the runtime/agent functionality.

**Detailed findings:**
- nucleus/src/agent/bsc.rs directly defines BSC_CHAIN_ID = 56 and BSC_URL = ""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org"". It issues JSON-RPC payloads to that endpoint for eth_gasPrice, eth_sendRawTransaction, and a custom eth_getTransactionDataAndReceipt. The file implements parsing of transaction data/receipt, detection of transfers to a given recipient address, issue_token() which builds contract deployment bytecode, signs the transaction (chain_id set to 56/U64::from(56)) and sends the raw signed tx to the BSC RPC. The code also computes the tx v value with BSC chain id formula. This is direct implementation evidence of BSC mainnet interaction.
- nucleus/src/agent/mod.rs and nucleus/src/nucleus.rs call into bsc::* functions (e.g. initiate_query_bsc_transaction, query_gas_price, issue_token) as part of on-chain flows (activating communities, checking fees, token issuance). Those calls demonstrate the BSC code paths are used by the runtime logic.
- nucleus/src/agent/contract.rs contains the contract bytecode constant (BYTECODE) used by issue_token() to deploy contracts on the chain.

Per the project evaluation criteria, this is concrete implementation evidence (in Rust code) of BSC mainnet integration.

tokens_registry,bnb-chain,https://github.com/gluexprotocol/tokens_registry,https://github.com/gluexprotocol/tokens_registry,TRUE,"Findings

- I examined the TypeScript implementation and repository configuration files. Concrete BSC (BNB Chain) references appear in implementation/configuration files (not just README). These are actionable configuration/usage artifacts (chain id mapping, RPC endpoints, and a token registry file for chainId 56) used by the runtime code.

Key points:
- src/routes/rpc.ts and src/routes/token.ts both include a runtime chainMap with an explicit mapping for BNB => '56'. This is implementation code (TypeScript) and not just documentation.
- The RPC loader (src/routes/rpc.ts) reads chains/metadata.json at runtime. chains/metadata.json contains an entry with key 'bnb', id: 56 and metamask.rpcUrls that include multiple BSC mainnet RPC endpoints (for example ""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org"", ""https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org"", etc.). This is a configuration file used by the implementation.
- The registry/56.json file contains many contract addresses (0x... format) and token entries for chainId 56 (BSC). The implementation instantiates TokenRegistry('./registry') and RPCFetch('./chains/metadata.json') in src/index.ts, so these registry entries and chain metadata are actually consumed by the code.

Conclusion: Because the implementation code contains (1) chain id 56 mapping, (2) BSC mainnet RPC URLs in configuration that the code reads, and (3) a registry file with many BSC contract addresses that the server loads and uses, this repository contains concrete implementation-level evidence of BSC/BNB Chain support.

arec-sdk,bnb-chain,https://github.com/arkreen/arec-sdk,https://github.com/arkreen/arec-sdk,TRUE,"Summary:

I found concrete, in-code evidence that this SDK is configured for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet. The repository contains TypeScript implementation files (not README/docs) that: (1) include ChainId entries for BSC (56) and BSC_TESTNET (97), (2) provide BSC-targeted INIT_CODE_HASH, and (3) hardcode many BSC mainnet contract addresses (factory, router, WBNB, etc.) under the ChainId.BSC keys in implementation code. These are direct, concrete configuration values in implementation files and therefore satisfy the criteria for BSC deployment evidence in implementation code.

Specific concrete evidence (implementation files):
- src/constants.ts contains ChainId enum including BSC = 56 and many address maps with [ChainId.BSC] entries. Examples:
  - INIT_CODE_HASH[ChainId.BSC] = '0x02a87956...'
  - FACTORY_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x69752367a0720963Aec78760EeAa208aFcF09122'
  - ROUTER_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x364cD4f1202a48e9e6C6De502B2dde572Ef57281'
  - FESW_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x31C6ba28f9692564a6ebd516676f2D49ac8C0dba'
  - STAKE_FACTORY_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x9B592DbCf45F8260657BC9Ac8BB3bCFE2C83d99C'
  - GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x7725f9A802E1612eC5e5Bf65A73D4318cdA0C4a9'
  - TIMELOCK_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0xC2078563d1cE2B8fF241A087B37344A7Ea0a07Dd'
  - NFT_BID_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] = '0x928d6F271F4CdEa1A544F40898350d1Ba55018D4'

- src/entities/token.ts and src/entities/token.ts WNATIVE/WETH maps include BSC WBNB addresses:
  - WNATIVE_ADDRESS[ChainId.BSC] (WBNB) = '0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c'
  - WETH[ChainId.BSC] token constructed as WBNB address with symbol 'WBNB'.

Why this meets the criteria:
- The CRITICAL REQUIREMENT asked for concrete evidence in implementation code (TypeScript, Solidity, config files). The above addresses and chain ID are present in TypeScript implementation files (src/constants.ts and src/entities/token.ts). These are not just README mentions or comments — they are concrete configuration entries used by the SDK at runtime to reference chain-specific contracts. The criteria explicitly list ""Contract addresses (0x... format) in deployment scripts or configuration files"" as valid evidence; here they are present in configuration constants used by the library.

Notes / caveats:
- This repository is an SDK and does not appear to include deployment scripts (migrations, Hardhat/Truffle config, or on-chain transaction hashes). There are no dedicated deploy/CI artifacts found in the scanned files that show the project itself executed deployments on BSC. However, the presence of BSC-specific addresses and chain constants in the implementation is sufficient (per your criteria) to confirm the code expects and targets BSC mainnet addresses.
- No verification metadata (e.g., BscScan verification artifacts) is present in the repo.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/arkreen/contracts,https://github.com/arkreen/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/NOVARIC-Ltd/contracts,https://github.com/NOVARIC-Ltd/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

dex-contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/thirdfi/dex-contracts,https://github.com/thirdfi/dex-contracts,TRUE,"Concrete implementation-level evidence for BNB Chain (BSC) deployment exists in the repository implementation files (not just README). Specifically:

- parameters/index.js defines a 'bnb' configuration that sets the PancakeSwap router (0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E) and a Proxy contract address (0x013B7E3D393DCE5fDb8C2F7890419cbd8ca8F7EE). The PancakeSwap router address is the canonical BSC mainnet router and the Proxy address corresponds to the BNB Chain/ BSC forwarder used by the project. These are concrete contract addresses and chain-specific configuration inside an implementation file.
- hardhat.config.js contains a networks.bnb entry with url: process.env.RPC_BSC and accounts configured. The Hardhat config also includes etherscan api keys for 'bsc' and 'bscTestnet'. This is concrete configuration that targets BSC RPC endpoints (via the RPC_BSC environment variable) and supports BSC verification.
- Deployment scripts (scripts/deploy.js, scripts/upgrade.js, scripts/verify.js) are structured to use the parameters mapping (params[networkName]) and perform upgrade/deploy/verify flows using the router/trustedForwarder/proxy addresses.

bsc-genesis-contract,bnb-chain,https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-genesis-contract,https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-genesis-contract,TRUE,"Concrete implementation-level evidence in the repository shows this project is intended for and used with BNB Smart Chain (BSC) / BSC mainnet (chainId 56). The evidence is not limited to README or docs — it appears in Solidity test/deployer code and TypeScript scripts and configuration code:

- test/utils/Deployer.sol (Solidity) contains an explicit runtime assertion that the chain id equals 56 (BSC mainnet). This is a concrete, compile/run-time check inside implementation code used when running tests or etching system contracts: assertEq(block.chainid, 56);
- The same Deployer.sol file hardcodes BSC system contract addresses (0x0000...1000, 0x0000...1001, 0x0000...1002, 0x0000...1003, 0x0000...1004, etc.) and uses vm.etch to deploy code to those addresses. Those addresses are BSC system contract addresses (and appear across multiple implementation files).
- scripts/bep171-unlock-bot.ts (TypeScript) uses a BSC RPC endpoint (BSC_RPC_URL = ""https://bsc-dataseed2.ninicoin.io"") and interacts with TokenHub at the BSC system address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001004. This is an actual script that would run against a BSC node.
- scripts/check-bsc-hardfork-bytecode.ts (TypeScript) clones the BSC repo and compares genesis/system contract bytecode from repo to the generated genesis — clearly BSC-specific tooling and integration logic.
- scripts/generate-genesis.js reads compiled contract bytecode and generates genesis.json with BSC-specific extraData and system bytecode entries (used to create BSC genesis files).

Because these items are implementation files (.sol, .ts, .js) containing explicit chain-id checks, BSC RPC endpoint, BSC system addresses, and tooling that targets the BNB Chain repo, the repository contains concrete evidence of BSC deployment intent and integration.

Concrete evidence in implementation code shows this project targets BNB Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet (chainId 56). The repository contains explicit network configuration (chain id + RPC URL + block explorer) in TypeScript implementation files and BSC-related contract addresses used in provider configuration. These are implementation files (not README) and therefore meet the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT for concrete evidence.

Key points (with references)

- apps/canonical-bridge-ui/token-config/mainnet/chains.ts defines a chain with id: 56, name: 'BNB Smart Chain', and rpcUrls.default.http: ['https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org']. This is an implementation TypeScript file containing the BSC mainnet network configuration.
- apps/canonical-bridge-ui/token-config/mainnet/useTransferConfig.ts uses defaultToChainId: 56 and includes chainOrders where 56 is present. This shows the UI/sdk is configured to transfer to BSC mainnet by default.
- apps/canonical-bridge-ui/token-config/mainnet/useTransferConfig.ts also contains excludedTokens mapping keyed by chain id 56 and lists token addresses (for example WBNB 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c). Those are concrete contract addresses associated with chain 56 in implementation code.

- The repository contains concrete implementation code that targets a BSC mainnet RPC endpoint and uses it to read token data from on-chain contracts. This is not just README/documentation text — it is executable TypeScript implementation code that instantiates an ethers provider pointed at a BSC mainnet RPC URL and creates Contract instances using token L1 addresses.

Key implementation evidence (examples):
- scripts/utils.ts defines a BSC RPC endpoint (BSC_ENDPOINT = ""https://bsc.nodereal.io"") and constructs a bscProvider (new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(BSC_ENDPOINT)).
- The same file constructs an ethers.Contract for token.l1Address using bscProvider and calls ERC20 view methods (name(), symbol(), decimals()) against that provider, i.e., it directly queries the token contract on BSC.
- The validation scripts (scripts/validate.ts and scripts/validate_changes.ts) iterate tokens from opbnb.tokenlist.json or data/*/data.json and call validateToken, which performs on-chain checks against both the opBNB RPC and the BSC RPC.

Because of the above, the repository contains concrete implementation-level evidence of interaction with BSC mainnet endpoints and BSC contract addresses, meeting the required criteria for concrete BSC deployment evidence in implementation code.","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['scripts/utils.ts: const BSC_ENDPOINT = ""https://bsc.nodereal.io"" (explicit BSC mainnet RPC URL)', 'scripts/utils.ts: const bscProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(BSC_ENDPOINT) (creates an ethers provider pointed at BSC)', 'scripts/utils.ts: new ethers.Contract(token.l1Address, ERC20_ABI, bscProvider) (instantiates contract using token.l1Address on BSC provider)', 'scripts/utils.ts: validateToken() calls bscContract.name(), bscContract.symbol(), bscContract.decimals() to read on-chain data from BSC', 'scripts/validate.ts and scripts/validate_changes.ts: these call validateToken() for tokens listed in opbnb.tokenlist.json or data/*/data.json, thereby driving BSC contract reads', 'scripts/gen_tokenlist.ts: reads data/*/data.json including l1Address and l2Address fields and generates opbnb.tokenlist.json (uses L1 addresses programmatically)'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md mentions opBNB and token lists (README alone is not counted as deployment evidence per criteria)', 'tokenlist_schema.md describing l1/l2 semantics (documentation only)', 'opbnb.tokenlist.json and data/*.json token info when considered as documentation only (but note: these are used by scripts so they contribute as data inputs; README-only mentions would be insufficient)'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['scripts/utils.ts', 'scripts/validate.ts', 'scripts/validate_changes.ts', 'scripts/gen_tokenlist.ts', 'package.json', 'opbnb.tokenlist.json', 'data/BTCB/data.json', 'data/ETH/data.json', 'data/FDUSD/data.json', 'data/XCAD/data.json', 'data/USDT/data.json', 'README.md', 'tokenlist_schema.md'], 'contract_structure': 'This repository does not contain Solidity smart contract source or deployment scripts for contracts.

bsc-staking-indexer,bnb-chain,https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-staking-indexer,https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-staking-indexer,TRUE,"Concrete implementation-level evidence shows this project targets BSC (BNB Chain) mainnet. Evidence found in configuration and Go implementation code includes:

- configs/config-example.toml contains an RPC URL pointing to a BSC mainnet dataseed: `https://bsc-dataseed3.bnbchain.org` and BSC-related start block number. The indexer code (indexer.New) reads this RPCURL and calls ethclient.DialOptions with it, so the program will connect to that BSC RPC endpoint at runtime.

- The repository module name and go.mod replacements explicitly reference BNB Chain: `module github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-staking-indexer` and go.mod replaces `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum => github.com/bnb-chain/bsc v1.4.6`. The code therefore depends on bnb-chain's go-ethereum (BSC client) instead of upstream geth.

- A BSC contract address is present in implementation code: stakehub parser sets `Address = common.HexToAddress(""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002002"")`. This is an on-chain contract address used by the code when creating the stakehub contract binding (New(client) returns NewContract(Address, client)).

- Contract bindings (generated Go files under contract/) use BNB-specific naming (GetPooledBNB, totalPooledBNB, RewardReceived events, etc.), and the code uses those bindings to parse logs from on-chain BNB/validator contracts.

I inspected the implementation files in the repository (TypeScript sources, tests, and config). The repository contains concrete implementation-level configuration that targets Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet: specifically, the Chain ID for BSC mainnet (56) is defined in an implementation file (src/types.ts), and the code includes a mainnet API endpoint used when the 'bsc' network option is selected (src/provider.ts -> 'https://zk-api.bnbchain.org'). Both items are present in actual implementation code (not README/docs), which satisfies the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT that evidence be in implementation files.

Key concrete evidence found (implementation code):
- src/types.ts defines BSC_NETWORK_CHAIN_ID = 56 (explicit BSC mainnet chain id).
- src/provider.ts: getZkBNBDefaultProvider maps the 'bsc' network to the endpoint 'https://zk-api.bnbchain.org' (an HTTP endpoint used by the provider implementation). The provider class uses this endpoint to fetch contract addresses at runtime.

Why this is sufficient: The criteria require explicit BSC mainnet configuration in implementation files (chain id 56, mainnet RPC/endpoint or deployment targeting BSC). The repo contains chain id 56 in a TypeScript source file and a concrete mainnet API endpoint used by the runtime provider. These are not README-only references — they appear in code that configures network behavior. No additional README-only mentions are needed to confirm BSC targeting; the implementation code meets the requirement.

Limitations / what was NOT found:
- I did not find hardcoded BSC mainnet contract addresses (0x... addresses) in the primary implementation sources (contract addresses are retrieved from the provider endpoint at runtime via /api/v1/layer2BasicInfo).
- I did not find deployment scripts that push contracts to BSC mainnet (no hardhat/truffle deploy scripts specific to BSC mainnet present in the repository files provided).
- No BSCscan verification records or transaction hashes are present in implementation files.

Conclusion: Because implementation code explicitly contains the BSC mainnet chain id (56) and a mainnet provider endpoint for the 'bsc' network, this repository demonstrates concrete BSC mainnet deployment configuration in code.

Evidence found in actual implementation/configuration code (not README):

- config/config.yml contains a BscRpcUrl set to the official BSC mainnet RPC: ""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"". This is an implementation configuration file read at runtime.
- cmd/migrate.go uses ethclient.Dial(cfg.BscRpcUrl) (implementation code) to connect to the RPC endpoint loaded from config, and then builds and sends transactions (pack createValidator and SendTransaction) to the StakeHub contract — demonstrating runtime behavior targeting that RPC.
- utils/config.go defines a StakeHubAddress constant (common.HexToAddress(""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002002"")) and the tx signing helpers in utils/utils.go set the transaction To field to this StakeHubAddress. The code therefore constructs transactions addressed to a contract address in the implementation.
- go.mod contains a replace directive mapping github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum to github.com/bnb-chain/bsc (a BSC-specific fork of geth). That dependency-level replacement is explicit implementation evidence of BSC-specific integration.

Notes and caveats:
- The README.md also references the same factory address and links it to bscscan (bscscan.com). README evidence alone would be insufficient, but the same factory address is present in the implementation deployment script, which meets the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT that evidence appear in implementation code.
- There is no explicit chainId = 56 or BSC RPC URL in code/config files.

However, the presence of the BSC factory address in the deployment script is concrete evidence in implementation files per the specified criteria.
- There are no on-chain verification artifacts (e.g., verification scripts calling BscScan API) in the repo; README contains the bscscan link but verification status is not provided in implementation code.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/coscription/contracts,https://github.com/coscription/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

synclub-contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/lista-dao/synclub-contracts,https://github.com/lista-dao/synclub-contracts,TRUE,"Concrete implementation code in this repository contains multiple BSC-specific artifacts and addresses indicating actual deployment/interaction on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Key concrete evidence found in implementation files (not README) includes:

- A Foundry test that explicitly forks BSC mainnet via an environment variable named BSC_RPC: test/foundry/ListaStakeManagerMainnet.t.sol contains vm.createSelectFork(vm.envString(""BSC_RPC""), 45946093). This is a direct programmatic reference to BSC RPC and a specific BSC mainnet block number.

- Real BSC mainnet contract addresses embedded in implementation code and scripts (not just documentation). Examples: 0x1adB950d8bB3dA4bE104211D5AB038628e477fE6 (proxy/stakeManager), 0xB0b84D294e0C75A6abe60171b70edEb2EFd14A1B (slisBnb), plus other mainnet addresses used in deploy scripts (see scripts/deploy_autoRefunder.ts mainnet section).

- Smart contract code targets BSC-specific precompile / on-chain addresses: constants NATIVE_STAKING = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002001 and STAKE_HUB = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002002 and GOV_BNB = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002005 are present in contracts/oldContracts/* and contracts/ListaStakeManager.sol — these precompile addresses are BSC-specific integration points (native staking / stake hub / BNB governance token addresses).

- Deployment scripts explicitly reference mainnet BSC addresses and a mainnet branch (scripts/deploy_autoRefunder.ts uses a branch when hrc.network.name === ""mainnet"" and hardcodes several addresses used for mainnet deployment). Additionally, scripts/upgrade_qa.ts and scripts/deploy_qa.ts reference proxy addresses that look like deployed mainnet proxies (e.g. stakeManagerProxy = ""0xc695F964011a5a1024931E2AF0116afBaC41B31B"").

- Hardhat configuration includes network slots named mainnet/testnet that point to SMART_CHAIN_RPC and CHAIN_ID environment variables (environment variables are used so operators can point these to BSC RPC and chain id 56). While CHAIN_ID is not hardcoded to 56 in the repo, the presence of SMART_CHAIN_RPC/CHAIN_ID variables and use of BSC-specific precompile addresses and mainnet addresses in code demonstrates concrete BSC targeting and actual mainnet forking/testing.

- The broadcast outputs produced by Foundry (files under broadcast/) include transaction records with chainId = 0x38 and ""chain"": 56 and show created contract addresses and transaction hashes (e.g. BeraChainVaultAdapter at 0xd113dbb2f3463a0d290c47d4e9edfba9e9195a16 with tx hash 0x9378aa0e78ced9feeb1961724abda4d1a389eb575438d13c1ddd05b19fa07fcd; SafeGuard at 0x79cfad1b5201cd0076208191f34b03497d30cc3f with tx hash 0x3f38211e5ab27091f72f8c99a0662f12b10855730598a2019576bc6272cf9a55). These are actual deployment records in implementation artifacts (JSON) created by forge broadcast and contain on-chain fields (blockNumber, blockHash, logs, etc.).

Test code and scripts also directly reference on-chain BSC addresses. These are implementation files (.sol) and configuration (foundry.toml) containing explicit BSC network and address information.

- The repository contains concrete implementation/configuration evidence that targets BSC mainnet. Specifically:
  - foundry.toml includes an rpc_endpoints entry named ""bsc-main"" pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC URL (https://bsc-mainnet.nodereal.io/...). This is a configuration file used by Foundry and qualifies as implementation/config evidence of a BSC mainnet endpoint.
  - The Solidity test test/BeraChain.t.sol calls vm.createSelectFork(""bsc-main""), which directly references the foundry.toml ""bsc-main"" RPC endpoint. This is implementation/test code that instructs Foundry to fork BSC mainnet for tests — concrete evidence of BSC mainnet usage.
  - The same test file contains a hardcoded BSC mainnet token contract address: BTCB = IERC20(0x7130d2A12B9BCbFAe4f2634d864A1Ee1Ce3Ead9c). This 0x... address appears in implementation (test) code and is a known BSC token address (BTCB on BSC). Hardcoded mainnet contract addresses in code meet the repository's requirement for concrete deployment evidence.

Conclusion: Because the repository contains configuration (foundry.toml) with a BSC mainnet RPC URL and implementation/test code that forks that endpoint and references a BSC mainnet token address, the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT is satisfied: there is concrete evidence in implementation/configuration files that the project targets BSC mainnet.

- hardhat.config.ts defines networks named ""bsc"" and ""bscTestnet"" and maps Etherscan apiKey entries for BSC (bsc and bscTestnet) when process.env.BSC_API_KEY is provided. This is explicit network configuration for BSC in implementation code.
- Multiple deployment and utility scripts reference BSC mainnet contract addresses (for PancakeSwap router, MasterChef, CAKE, WBNB, BUSD, etc.), and scripts are built to deploy/verify to those networks (e.g., deployAll.ts, apr.ts, deployStableCoinStrategy.ts).

- I inspected the implementation TypeScript files (not just the README). The code contains explicit BSC mainnet configuration inside implementation files: the CAIP-2 identifier for BSC mainnet (eip155:56) and a BSC mainnet RPC endpoint (https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org) are present in src/constants/networks.ts and src/constants/metadata.ts respectively. These are concrete implementation artifacts (not README text) and match the allowed evidence in the criteria (chain id 56 and BSC RPC URL configured in implementation code). 

What I found that satisfies the criteria

- src/constants/networks.ts defines NETWORKS.BSC.MAINNET as `${NAMESPACES.EVM}:56` (explicit chain id 56). This is an implementation file and a direct configuration of the BSC chain id.
- src/constants/metadata.ts includes an entry for [NETWORKS.BSC.MAINNET] with name ""BNB Smart Chain"", currency ""BNB"", explorerUrl ""https://bscscan.com"", and rpcUrl ""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org"". This is an implementation-level RPC endpoint configured for BSC mainnet.

Therefore, per the provided verification rules (which list chain id 56 and BSC RPC URLs in implementation files as valid concrete evidence), the repository contains concrete implementation evidence indicating BSC mainnet support/configuration.

- BondingCurve.sol hardcodes Pancake-related contract addresses (PANCAKE_V3_FACTORY, PANCAKE_V3_ROUTER, NONFUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER) pointing to concrete on-chain addresses. Those constants are implementation-level references to PancakeSwap V3 components (a BSC-specific DEX ecosystem).

- The contracts use Cashier.isNative(token) with native token handling for BNB (msg.value checks, deposits/withdrawals), and the Cashier.nativeToken() explicitly returns known WBNB addresses for chain IDs 97 (testnet) and 56 (mainnet).

ilmt-contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/GESP-IT-SOLUTIONS/ilmt-contracts,https://github.com/GESP-IT-SOLUTIONS/ilmt-contracts,TRUE,"**Conclusion:** The repository contains concrete implementation-level configuration targeting BSC (BNB Chain) mainnet. Specifically, hardhat.config.ts includes a networks.bnb entry with the BSC mainnet RPC URL and chainId 56, and the etherscan config maps a BSC API key (bnb/tbsc). This is concrete evidence in implementation/config code that the project is configured for BSC mainnet deployment. Note: there is no evidence of an actual verified on-chain deployment (no tx hashes or verified contract artifacts), but the presence of the BSC RPC + chainId in the repo's Hardhat configuration satisfies the requirement for concrete BSC deployment configuration in implementation files.

Detailed findings (implementation-code evidence):
- hardhat.config.ts defines networks.bnb with url ""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"" and chainId: 56 — this is an explicit BSC mainnet RPC + chain id in implementation code.
- hardhat.config.ts also sets etherscan.apiKey entries for bnb and tbsc using process.env.BSC_API_KEY — indicates intent and configuration for BSC verification via Etherscan/BscScan in implementation code.

Caveats:
- No BscScan verification records or transaction hashes are present in repository implementation files.
- Deployment scripts exist (scripts/*.ts) but do not explicitly call --network bnb; however the Hardhat config contains the BSC network configuration, enabling deployment to BSC via those scripts when invoked with --network bnb. The presence of network config in implementation code is sufficient per the criteria (chain id 56 and RPC URL present in implementation files).

There are no BscScan verification artifacts or explicit transaction hashes in the repo, but the presence of chain id 56 and BSC RPC endpoints in implementation code, combined with deployment scripts containing a concrete address, meets the criteria for confirming that this project is configured/deployed (or at least intended to be deployed) on BSC mainnet in code.

Key findings:
- hardhat.config.ts defines a 'bsc' network (uses process.env.RPC_URL_BSC and an account env var PK_ACCOUNT_BSC) and also a 'bsc_test' network. This is an implementation/config file (TypeScript) that explicitly configures a BSC network name and RPC URL environment variable usage.
- package.json contains deployment scripts that invoke Hardhat with --network bsc (e.g. ""d:bsc"": ""npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network bsc"", and ""d:energy:bsc""), i.e. deployment scripts which target the configured 'bsc' network.
- hardhat.config.ts configures etherscan/apiKey entries for 'bsc' and 'bscTestnet' (BSCSCAN_API_KEY), indicating intended BscScan verification integration in implementation code.

whitelist,bnb-chain,https://github.com/alphaquark/whitelist,https://github.com/alphaquark/whitelist,TRUE,"## Findings

I found concrete implementation-code evidence that this project includes BSC (BNB Chain) mainnet token addresses and programmatic handling for ChainId.BSC:

- whitelists/chainlink/src/tokens/bsc.js contains an array of 0x... addresses that correspond to known BSC mainnet token contracts (for example: WBNB 0xbb4C..., BUSD 0xe9e7..., CAKE 0x0E09F..., USDT 0x55d398..., BTCB 0x7130d2...). These are actual contract addresses present in implementation code (module.exports array).

- whitelists/chainlink/build.js contains a FILE_NAME mapping that includes an entry for ChainId.BSC -> ""bsc"" and the script will require ./src/tokens/bsc.js when ChainId.BSC exists. This demonstrates the code intends to load the BSC token whitelist programmatically (implementation code that ties the ChainId.BSC constant to the bsc token list).

Why this meets the repository's concrete-evidence requirement

- The criterion requires concrete evidence in implementation files. The token address list is in an actual implementation file (JavaScript) and is not merely documentation/README. The build script explicitly maps the ChainId.BSC key to the bsc.js token file and attempts to require it if it exists. That combination is implementation-level evidence that the project contains BSC mainnet token addresses and will include them in outputs.

Limitations / what is NOT present

- There are no deployment scripts (migrations/deploy.js), no hardhat/truffle network configuration files, no explicit numeric chainId (56) literal in the repository, and no RPC endpoints or BSC network configuration files. There is no on-chain verification metadata or transaction hashes in the codebase. However, the presence of mainnet BSC contract addresses in implementation files plus the build mapping to ChainId.BSC is sufficient concrete evidence per the stated criteria (contract addresses in implementation code and use of ChainId.BSC in build script).

Conclusion

- Based on concrete implementation-code evidence (the bsc.js token list and the build.js mapping to ChainId.BSC), I conclude the project includes BSC mainnet token addresses and is therefore confirmed as deployed/targeting BSC in the sense required by the criteria (presence of BSC mainnet contract addresses in implementation code).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['whitelists/chainlink/src/tokens/bsc.js — module.exports array contains numerous 0x... addresses corresponding to BSC mainnet tokens (e.g. 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c for WBNB, 0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56 for BUSD, 0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82 for CAKE, etc.)', 'whitelists/chainlink/build.js — FILE_NAME mapping includes [ChainId.BSC]: ""bsc"" and the script requires ./src/tokens/bsc.js when present, linking the ChainId.BSC constant to the bsc token file in implementation code.'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md — contains only a title (# Whitelist) and provides no implementation evidence.

I found concrete BSC mainnet deployment evidence inside implementation files in the repository. Specifically, there are token metadata files under the `bsc/` directory that include BSC contract addresses (0x... format) and bscscan explorer URLs. These are not README-only mentions — they exist as implementation/data files (.js and .sol) within the code tree and include explicit BEP20 type and bscscan links. 

What I did NOT find: there are no hardhat/truffle network configs, no RPC endpoints, no deployment scripts or transaction hashes in the analyzed files. However, the presence of explicit 0x addresses and bscscan explorer links in implementation files meets the criterion of ""BSC contract addresses in implementation files"" required for concrete evidence.

- bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol contains id/address `0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365`, type `BEP20`.
- bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js contains id/address `0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b` and explorer `https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b`, type `BEP20`.

Conclusion: There is concrete implementation-level evidence (contract addresses and bscscan links) indicating these tokens are deployed on BSC mainnet. Therefore I mark the repository as having BSC deployment evidence in implementation files.

Caveat: The repository does not include deployment scripts, network configs (e.g., chainId=56 in hardhat/truffle config), RPC endpoints, or verification artifacts — only token metadata files that reference BSC addresses and bscscan. These metadata files are nonetheless implementation files containing concrete BSC addresses and so satisfy the critical requirement that evidence be in implementation files (not README/documentation only).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol — contains id/address 0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365, type BEP20', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js — contains id/address 0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, explorer https://bscscan.com/token/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b, type BEP20'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md and numerous chain-specific README files (e.g., solana/README.md, arbitrum/README.md, etc.) — these are documentation and were ignored per criteria', 'General repository README mentions of many chains — ignored because documentation-only', 'No hardhat/truffle configs or RPC endpoints discovered in provided files — absence noted but not treated as evidence'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['bsc/0x3629aaDC5605cB8cC9174bC15df05cdB7C27e365/info.sol', 'bsc/0x691aa1dca7329e656bcbc2f5573cbe158340346b/info.js', 'README.md', 'zeta/README.md', 'iost/README.md', 'kcc/Readme.md', 'solana/README.md', 'meta_20028/README.md', 'optimistic/README.md', 'xlayer/README.md', 'klaytn/README.md', 'bty_2999/README.md', 'bttc/README.md', 'FON_201022/README.md', 'zksync/README.md', 'blast/README.md', 'NFT/README.md', 'lat/Readme.md', 'fantom/README.md', 'scroll/README.md', 'fil/README.md', 'eos-evm/README.md', 'Avalanche-C/README.md', 'arbitrum/README.md'], 'contract_structure': 'The referenced files are token metadata records (JSON-like content) describing BEP20 tokens (name, symbol, decimals, status, id/address) and providing bscscan explorer URLs.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/naboxwallet/contracts,https://github.com/naboxwallet/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/MetaFabInc/contracts,https://github.com/MetaFabInc/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

etherspot-prime-contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/etherspot/etherspot-prime-contracts,https://github.com/etherspot/etherspot-prime-contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete deployment evidence for BSC (BNB Chain) was found in the repository in a deployment records file (DEPLOYMENTS.md). That file contains explicit entries under ""Mainnets"" for the `bsc` network with contract addresses and corresponding BscScan transaction hashes for EtherspotPaymaster, EtherspotWalletFactory and EtherspotWallet. These are concrete deployment records (addresses + tx hashes) stored in the repository (not only in README text). No explicit BSC network object (e.g. hardhat.config.js with chainId: 56 or RPC URLs) or deployment scripts were found in the analyzed implementation/config files — the evidence is the deployment records in DEPLOYMENTS.md which contain BSC addresses and tx links.

Why this qualifies as concrete evidence

- The evaluation criteria allows BSC mainnet transaction hashes or deployment records in implementation/configuration files as valid evidence. DEPLOYMENTS.md contains such deployment records and bscscan links (addresses + tx hashes). This is direct, concrete evidence of contracts deployed on BSC mainnet (addresses and transaction hashes pointing to bscscan.com).

Limitations / caveats

- I did not find a network configuration block (e.g., hardhat.config.js / truffle-config.js) that explicitly configures chainId 56 or a BSC RPC URL. I also did not find deployment scripts (e.g., scripts that target BSC) in the provided files. The single source of concrete BSC evidence in the repository is the DEPLOYMENTS.md file's recorded addresses and transaction hashes (and their bscscan links).

Conclusion

- Because concrete BSC mainnet deployment records (contract addresses + transaction hashes linking to bscscan) are present in the repository's DEPLOYMENTS.md, this meets the criteria for ""concrete deployment evidence"". Therefore the repository is marked as deployed on BSC, with the evidence coming from DEPLOYMENTS.md entries.","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': [""DEPLOYMENTS.md: In 'Mainnets' table the following BSC entries appear (addresses + bscscan tx hashes):\n  - EtherspotPaymaster | network `bsc` | address: 0xEA5ecE95D3A28f9faB161779d20128b449F9EC9C | tx: 0xa1362f0c2ed2823e2583adbf1365880309a7d1986812e9adb1f2cad8baf06c3e (links to bscscan.com)\n  - EtherspotWalletFactory | network `bsc` | address: 0x7f6d8F107fE8551160BD5351d5F1514A6aD5d40E | tx: 0x3bba93421c5ffbdbff3277c1f478216b63bb64b810835d6bddf613178c1d76d7 (links to bscscan.com)\n  - EtherspotWallet | network `bsc` | address: 0xfB32cef50CfB0A0F9f6d37A05828b2F56EfdfE20 | tx: 0x6e0e97118d0d3d716cb17916ffdfdae127a7b7edd0dac7ed98706e6001d7a751 (links to bscscan.com)"", 'DEPLOYMENTS.md provides explicit explorer links (https://bscscan.com/address/...) and transaction hash links (https://bscscan.com/tx/...), which are concrete deployment records in the repository.'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md: General README for the project (installation, usage).

- The repository contains a token list configuration file (stablecoins.tokenlist.json) that explicitly includes multiple entries with ""chainId"": 56 (BSC mainnet) and associated contract addresses. These appear in a configuration/implementation file (JSON) rather than only in README/documentation. The presence of chainId 56 paired with concrete 0x... addresses in the tokenlist is concrete implementation evidence per the criteria (BSC contract addresses in configuration files).

- No smart-contract source, deployment script, or network config (hardhat/truffle) files for deploying contracts to BSC are present in the provided files. There are also no RPC endpoints, transaction hashes, or verification artifacts in the repo.

- The repository contains JSON token lists that are part of the implementation data, including a top-level tokens/list.json that contains a ""56"" key and a dedicated tokens/56/list.json file containing BSC token contract addresses (0x... format).

komodo_wallet_coins,bnb-chain,https://github.com/Space-Crypto-Project/komodo_wallet_coins,https://github.com/Space-Crypto-Project/komodo_wallet_coins,TRUE,"Summary

- I inspected the repository files provided (README.md and the coins configuration file). While README mentions Binance Smart Chain (BNB) as a supported protocol (documentation-level mention), the concrete, implementation-level evidence is present in the coins configuration file. That file contains explicit BSC mainnet indicators: chain_id: 56, protocol entries with platform: ""BNB"", and many 0x... contract_address values. According to the criteria, contract addresses and chain_id: 56 in implementation/configuration files constitute valid, concrete evidence of BSC mainnet deployment support.

Concrete findings (highlights)

- The repository contains a configuration file named ""coins"" (JSON content) with many entries for BEP20 tokens that include:
  - ""chain_id"": 56 (explicitly indicating BSC mainnet)
  - ""protocol"": { ""type"": ""ERC20"", ""protocol_data"": { ""platform"": ""BNB"", ""contract_address"": ""0x..."" } }
- Example coin entries with BSC mainnet data are present for tokens such as 1INCH-BEP20, AAVE-BEP20, ADA-BEP20, BTC-BEP20, BUSD-BEP20, CAKE-BEP20, APE-BEP20, etc.

Why this meets the repository evidence criteria

- The CRITICAL REQUIREMENT demands concrete evidence in implementation/config files. The ""coins"" file is a configuration/implementation artifact used by the Komodo/AtomicDEX codebase to support networks and tokens. It contains explicit Chain ID 56 entries and contract addresses in 0x... format associated with platform: ""BNB"". The criteria list ""BSC contract addresses in configuration files"" and ""Chain ID 56 explicitly configured"" as valid evidence; both are satisfied here.

Notes and limitations

- The repository does not include RPC endpoint URLs or deployment scripts (hardhat/truffle) targeting BSC in the files provided. There are also some swap markdown files (documentation) with bscscan.com links; those are documentation and are insufficient by themselves, but they corroborate that actual transactions/explorers are used. However, documentation alone is not sufficient per the rules — the coins file provides the required implementation-level evidence.

Conclusion

- Based on concrete evidence in the implementation/configuration file (the ""coins"" JSON), this project includes explicit BSC mainnet configuration: chain_id 56, platform ""BNB"", and BEP20 contract addresses. Therefore, per the given criteria, it can be marked as deployed/on BSC (i.e., the repository contains concrete implementation evidence of BSC mainnet tokens).","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': ['coins (JSON) contains multiple entries with ""chain_id"": 56 (explicit BSC mainnet chain id)', 'coins (JSON) contains protocol_data.platform = ""BNB"" for many tokens (indicates BSC/BNB Chain)', 'coins (JSON) contains multiple BEP20 contract addresses in 0x... format under protocol_data.contract_address (implementation/configuration file)'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md mentions Binance Smart Chain and BEP20 tokens (documentation-level mention) — ignored per rules', 'swaps/*.md files contain bscscan.com links to transactions (documentation/markdown) — ignored as standalone evidence'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['README.md', 'coins', 'slp/bchd_urls.json', 'swaps/*.md (examined for context but considered documentation only)'], 'contract_structure': 'The repository contains a coins configuration JSON with entries representing coins/tokens.

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/Space-Crypto-Project/contracts,https://github.com/Space-Crypto-Project/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

supply-tracker,bnb-chain,https://github.com/omniaprotocol/supply-tracker,https://github.com/omniaprotocol/supply-tracker,TRUE,"Findings summary:

- The repository contains concrete implementation-code evidence that the project queries BSC mainnet (BscScan) and references multiple BEP20 contract addresses in executable JavaScript (index.js). This is not just README or comments — it is runtime code that builds requests to BSC mainnet APIs and lists on-chain BEP20 addresses used for balance/supply calculation.

Key code evidence (from index.js):
- The code chooses api endpoints by chain string and uses api.bscscan.com / bscscan.com when chain === 'BSC', i.e. it explicitly targets the BSC mainnet API endpoints.
- The code requires and expects a BSCSCAN_API_KEY environment variable (process.env.BSCSCAN_API_KEY) and a BEP20 contract address env var (process.env.BEP20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS) which are used when querying BSC.
- There is a concrete bep20Addresses array in the implementation (index.js) that includes multiple 0x... addresses with chain: 'BSC' entries. These addresses are used by getTableRows() and supply computation logic.
- The function getTokenSupply('BSC') calls the BscScan API domain (api.bscscan.com) to fetch token supply for the BEP20 token.

Because these items are in actual implementation code (index.js) and not only documentation/README, this satisfies the repository's concrete evidence requirement for BSC mainnet interaction/deployment.

Notes about other files/mentions:
- README.md mentions BSC in narrative (insufficient by itself), but there is also concrete code evidence as described above.

TidalDex-Telegram-Bot,bnb-chain,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/TidalDex-Telegram-Bot,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/TidalDex-Telegram-Bot,TRUE,"Summary:

Concrete implementation code shows this project is explicitly targeting Binance Smart Chain (BSC / BSC Mainnet). The evidence is present in multiple implementation files (not README/documentation):

- download_tokens.py contains a runtime filter that only includes tokens with token['chainId'] == 56 (BSC mainnet chain id). This is a direct, concrete reference to BSC inside implementation code.
- main.py expects a BSC RPC endpoint via the environment variable BSC_RPC_URL and uses Web3 to connect using that value (w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(BSC_RPC_URL))). This is implementation-level configuration for connecting to a BSC node.
- main.py formats transaction links to BscScan (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x{tx_hash}) when composing alerts. That shows the code treats transactions it observes as BSC transactions and provides BscScan links.

These items are concrete implementation-level evidence (Python code) and are not merely README mentions. There are no on-chain contract deployment scripts or hard-coded contract addresses in the repo, but the presence of chainId == 56, the BSC RPC env variable usage in code, and BscScan link generation together constitute concrete implementation evidence that this project is intended to run against and monitor the BSC mainnet.

Note about limitations:
- There are no deployment scripts, network config files (hardhat/truffle), or hard-coded BSC RPC endpoints or contract addresses in the repository. Also no verified contract addresses or BscScan verification artifacts are present. If your definition of ""deployed on BSC"" requires presence of on-chain deployed contract addresses or deployment artifacts in the repo, those are not present.

- components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx: UI checks for chainId == 56 and shows a ""BSC"" indicator or ""BSC Not Connected"". The wallet-connect/activation messages explicitly reference BSC (e.g. ""No BSC wallet found...""). This demonstrates the runtime logic expects BSC mainnet chainId (56).

- constants/addresses.js and usage in pages/Home/index.js: The code defines multiple 0x... addresses for known BSC tokens (BUSD, USDC, USDT, CZUSD) and a contract address ADDRESS_DGGSALE = 0x90e503b6AD934Af6452eB81B056bb1A2Ed003aD9 which the frontend constructs an ethers.Contract with and calls methods (depositBnb, depositCzusd, depositUsdt).

- I found concrete, implementation-level evidence that this project is configured to connect to BSC mainnet and interacts with contracts at BSC mainnet addresses. This evidence is present in runtime/config/implementation files (JavaScript/TypeScript), not just README or docs.

Key findings (implementation-level):

1. Numeric BSC chain ID check in UI code: components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx contains an explicit check for chainId == 56 and displays BSC / BSC Not Connected accordingly. This is a direct numeric reference to BSC mainnet chain ID (56).

2. BSC RPC configured in DApp provider: pages/_app.js config uses BSC from @usedapp/core and sets readOnlyUrls with a BSC RPC endpoint ('https://bsc.rpc.blxrbdn.com') and networks: [BSC]. This is a concrete runtime network configuration pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC.

3. Concrete BSC contract/token addresses in implementation code: constants/addresses.js contains well-known BSC mainnet token addresses (BUSD 0xe9e7CEA3..., USDT 0x55d39832..., USDC 0x8AC76a51...) and a DggSale contract address (0x90e503b6AD934Af6452eB81B056bb1A2Ed003aD9). These addresses are used by the frontend (pages/Home/index.js) to construct ethers.Contract instances and call contract functions (depositBnb, depositCzusd, depositUsdt) via the DggSale ABI.

4. The frontend uses the DggSale ABI and IERC20 ABI (abi/DggSale.json, abi/IERC20.json) and instantiates contracts with the above addresses (pages/Home/index.js). That is implementation code actively wired to those addresses and methods.

What this proves

- The project is implemented to connect to BSC mainnet at runtime (readOnlyUrls and networks include BSC) and contains numeric chain ID checks for 56.
- The frontend targets specific contract addresses that correspond to BSC mainnet tokens (BUSD/USDT/USDC) and a project contract (ADDRESS_DGGSALE). Those addresses are in implementation files and are used with ABIs in the code, i.e., the application expects those contracts to exist on BSC and will interact with them.

Limitations / notes

- There are no local deployment scripts (hardhat/truffle) or Solidity source files in this repo showing the contract was deployed from this repository. The evidence shows the frontend is configured against BSC mainnet and specific contract addresses, but not that this repository performed the on-chain deployment.
- There are no BscScan verification artifacts or verification JSON in the repo. I did not query external services; verification status is not represented inside the repository.

Conclusion

Because there is concrete evidence in implementation files (explicit chain ID 56 checks, BSC RPC endpoint in DApp provider config, and BSC mainnet contract addresses used by the code and ABIs), this project is deployed/targeting BSC (BNB Chain) from an implementation perspective. The repository shows the app will connect to and interact with contracts on BSC mainnet.","{'concrete_deployment_evidence': [""pages/_app.js: DAppProvider config uses BSC and sets readOnlyUrls with 'https://bsc.rpc.blxrbdn.com' and networks: [BSC] (implementation code)."", ""components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx: explicit numeric chainId check 'chainId == 56' to detect BSC mainnet (implementation code)."", 'constants/addresses.js: BSC mainnet token and contract addresses defined and exported (implementation code) — BUSD 0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56, USDT 0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955, USDC 0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d, ADDRESS_DGGSALE 0x90e503b6AD934Af6452eB81B056bb1A2Ed003aD9, ADDRESS_CZUSD 0xE68b79e51bf826534Ff37AA9CeE71a3842ee9c70.', 'pages/Home/index.js: Ethers Contract instances created with ADDRESS_DGGSALE and token addresses, using abi/DggSale.json and abi/IERC20.json and calling depositBnb/depositCzusd/depositUsdt functions (implementation code).', 'components/AccountModal/index.tsx and components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx: UI strings and behavior referencing BSC and BSCScan (implementation code).'], 'insufficient_evidence': ['README.md: generic NextJs starter - not related to BSC deployment (ignored).', ""UI strings alone such as 'Show on BSCScan', 'No BSC wallet found', 'Use BNB' — these textual mentions, while present in implementation files, would be insufficient on their own (but here they are supported by concrete config and addresses)."", 'No hardhat/truffle config or migration scripts present in repo — lack of those files does not negate the runtime config, but they are absent and therefore not used as deployment proof.'], 'implementation_files_analyzed': ['pages/_app.js', 'components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx', 'components/AccountModal/index.tsx', 'pages/Home/index.js', 'constants/addresses.js', 'abi/DggSale.json', 'abi/IERC20.json', 'next.config.js', 'package.json', 'README.md'], 'contract_structure': 'The repository contains frontend code (React/Next.js) that loads ABIs (abi/DggSale.json and abi/IERC20.json) and creates ethers.Contract instances pointing at addresses defined in constants/addresses.js.

czodiac,bnb-chain,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czodiac,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czodiac,TRUE,"Found concrete BSC mainnet configuration and contract addresses in implementation/configuration files (not README). The file packages/sc/deployConfig.json contains multiple BSC mainnet contract addresses and PancakeSwap/WBNB/BUSD addresses that are specific to BSC mainnet. This is implementation-level configuration (JSON) used by the codebase and qualifies as concrete evidence per the criteria.

Key points:

- packages/sc/deployConfig.json includes PancakeSwap router and factory addresses, WBNB and BUSD mainnet addresses (BSC mainnet), and many other addresses used by the contracts. These are not just comments or README mentions — they are configuration values in an implementation/config file.
- A CSV with many 0x... addresses (packages/sc/pool-migration.csv) also exists in the implementation package and appears intended for on-chain migration/deploy operations.
- The Solidity contracts in the repo (flat-*.sol and contracts/*.sol) implement tokens and farm logic (CZFarm, CZUsd, CZFarmMasterRoutable, etc.) that reference ERC20, router/factory usage patterns and would be deployed to chains; combined with deployConfig.json the repository shows explicit BSC mainnet targets.

What I did NOT count as evidence: README files and comments were present but were ignored per the rules. No hardhat config files with chainId 56 were included in the provided files, and there are no explicit deployment scripts or tx hashes in the truncated flattened files provided.

czfarm-fe-v2,bnb-chain,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czfarm-fe-v2,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czfarm-fe-v2,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code in this repository explicitly configures and targets Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet. Evidence is present in application configuration and runtime code (not just README or comments). The DApp provider is configured to use BSC chain ID and BSC RPC endpoints and the UI checks for chainId == 56. Additionally, several contract interactions (via ethers/usedapp) and coingecko calls target BSC's ecosystem (e.g. 'binance-smart-chain').

Key concrete examples (implementation files):
- pages/_app.js: DAppProvider config sets readOnlyChainId to BSC.chainId and readOnlyUrls includes 'https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/'. WalletConnectV2Connector rpcMap contains an explicit mapping for chain id 56 pointing to 'https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc'. This is direct configuration of BSC mainnet RPC in implementation code.
- components/Web3ModalButton/index.tsx: UI checks if chainId == 56 and displays ""BSC""/""Not BSC"" accordingly. This shows the app expects and validates the BSC mainnet chain ID.
- Multiple components call useCoingeckoTokenPrice/useCoingeckoPrice with platform 'binance-smart-chain' (e.g. components/ManageTribePool/index.js and components/ManageCopperPool/index.js) showing those price lookups are targeted to BSC token listings.
- Several hard-coded external links in implementation code reference BSC-specific endpoints (e.g. geckoterminal links that include '/bsc/pools/0x...'). Those appear in live UI code (Header component) and contain literal BSC pool contract addresses.

Because these are all present in actual implementation files (JS/TSX) and include explicit chain id (56) and BSC RPC endpoints, the criteria for concrete evidence of BSC deployment are met.

- hardhat.config.js explicitly uses BSC RPC endpoints (https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc) for forking and includes a 'bsc' network configuration. This is an implementation/config file (not README) and is direct evidence of BSC targeting.

- deployconfig.json contains many 0x... addresses (PancakeSwap Router/Factory and numerous contract addresses such as TownSquare, Gangs, CZUSD, etc.) which are used by scripts and tests. These addresses are concrete BSC mainnet-format addresses and are referenced by deployment and runtime scripts (implementation files) via loadJsonFile/getContractAt.

- Deployment scripts and other implementation files use deployconfig.json addresses with ethers.getContractAt or otherwise treat those addresses as deployed contracts (e.g., scripts/deploy-LocTemplateResource.js, scripts/deploy-townSquare.js, test files that call getContractAt with addresses from deployconfig.json). Those are actual implementation files referencing BSC addresses.

Taken together, the network configuration (BSC RPC) and the concrete BSC mainnet addresses in config + their usage in implementation scripts/tests satisfy the repository's concrete-evidence requirement for BSC deployment. There are no BscScan/verification artifacts or on-chain tx hashes in the repo, so verification outside this repo is not present here, but the implementation files do target BSC and reference deployed BSC addresses.

Key concrete examples (implementation files & lines):
- hardhat.config.js: forking.url = `https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc`; networks.bsc.url = `https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc` (explicit BSC RPC in implementation config).
- deployconfig.json: pancakeswapRouter = ""0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E"" and pancakeswapFactory = ""0xcA143Ce32Fe78f1f7019d7d551a6402fC5350c73"" (PancakeSwap addresses on BSC mainnet), and many other 0x... addresses used by scripts/tests.
- scripts/deploy-LocTemplateResource.js and scripts/deploy-townSquare.js (implementation/deployment scripts) load deployconfig.json and call getContractAt / deploy using those addresses.
- test files (e.g., test/locTemplateResource.js) call loadJsonFile.sync(""./deployconfig.json"") and then use getContractAt(..., AddressFromConfig) to interact with contracts at those addresses.

Therefore, per the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (evidence must be in implementation/config/deployment scripts), this repository contains concrete evidence of BSC mainnet targeting and usage.

czcash-v2,bnb-chain,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czcash-v2,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/czcash-v2,TRUE,"- Summary of findings

  The repository contains concrete implementation-code evidence that the frontend dApp is configured to operate on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) mainnet and references multiple known BSC-mainnet contract addresses. This evidence is present in implementation files (JSX/JS constant/config files), not merely in documentation or README. Key concrete items:

  - src/App.jsx explicitly imports and uses the bsc chain from wagmi (chains = [bsc]) and passes that to configureChains/createClient and the EthereumClient/Web3Modal setup. This is an explicit runtime chain configuration to BSC in implementation code.
  - src/constants/addresses.js contains many BSC-mainnet contract addresses (WBNB, BUSD, USDT, PancakeSwap router and factory, etc.). Several of these addresses match well-known BSC mainnet addresses (for example PancakeSwap router 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E and WBNB 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c), which demonstrates BSC mainnet targeting in the code.
  - src/constants/localTokens.js and other constants include tokens with addresses that are BSC-mainnet token addresses (WBNB, BUSD, USDT and project-specific tokens), and are used by the application logic (TokenList, Swap, etc.).
  - src/components/elements/TxStatus.jsx formats transaction links to https://bscscan.com/tx/<txHash>, confirming the UI expects transactions on BSC mainnet.
  - Additional BSC-related config references (LINK_COINGECKO_TOKENS pointing to Binance Smart Chain token list) appear in implementation code.

  Because these are concrete references inside implementation/configuration files (not README or docs), they satisfy the requirement that evidence be in implementation code. There are no deployment scripts or hardhat/truffle config files in the repository, so this is a frontend dApp configured to interact with contracts already deployed on BSC rather than a repo that contains deployment scripts. Nonetheless, the presence of the bsc chain selection and explicit mainnet addresses in implementation code is valid evidence of BSC deployment/targeting.

  Limitations & notes
  - I did not find any deployment scripts (hardhat/truffle/forge) or network config files that themselves run deployments to BSC in this repository.
  - I did not find contract verification metadata or explicit BscScan verification files. That does not negate the evidence above; it only means there is no verification artifact in the repo itself.

  Conclusion: The project is targeted / configured for BSC mainnet in implementation code (frontend), and concrete BSC mainnet addresses and chain selection are present. Therefore, per the criteria (implementation code evidence required), mark as deployed/targeting BSC (true).

divipool,bnb-chain,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/divipool,https://github.com/chinese-zodiac/divipool,TRUE,"Concrete implementation code in this repository contains multiple BSC (BNB Chain) specific artifacts: hardhat.config.js configures BSC RPC endpoints (used for forking and as an explicit network), and smart contracts/tests reference BSC mainnet contract addresses (PancakeSwap router & factory, BUSD token) and a CZUSD token address. These are present in implementation files (not README). This meets the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: evidence is in implementation/config files, not only documentation.

Specific highlights:
- hardhat.config.js: the hardhat network is configured to fork from https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc, and networks include a 'bsc' entry using https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc and a bscTestnet entry using the BSC testnet seed node. These are concrete RPC endpoints and network entries in an implementation/config file.
- contracts and tests: DIVIPOOL.sol, Gem.sol tests, GemBurner tests and other contract code reference BSC mainnet PancakeSwap addresses (router and factory) and BUSD token address in actual Solidity/JS code. DIVIPOOL.sol sets ammRouter = IAmmRouter02(0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E) and uses IAmmFactory(0xcA143Ce32Fe78f1f7019d7d551a6402fC5350c73).

- hardhat.config.js contains a bsc network entry with a BSC mainnet RPC endpoint (https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc) and a bscTestnet entry (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s2.binance.org:8545). The hardhat forking configuration explicitly forks from a BSC mainnet RPC URL (https://bsc-mainnet.nodereal.io/v1/${networkConfig.noderealRpcKey}). These are implementation/config files, not documentation.

- Multiple implementation files (tests and scripts) reference well-known BSC mainnet contract addresses (WBNB, BUSD, PancakeSwap router) and project-specific addresses used when interacting with deployed contracts. Examples include tests/test scripts that call PancakeSwap router swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens with path arrays including WBNB and BUSD, and constants that use the PancakeSwap Router v2 address (0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E).

contracts,bnb-chain,https://github.com/smolrefuel/contracts,https://github.com/smolrefuel/contracts,TRUE,"Summary

Concrete implementation code shows BSC (BNB Chain) configuration and explicit contract addresses used for deployment/interaction on BSC. Evidence includes:

- truffle-config.js contains a 'bsc' network entry with provider URL pointing to a BSC mainnet RPC (https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org) and network_id: 56. This is a configuration-level, implementation-file indication of targeting BSC mainnet.
- Deployment/migration and batch scripts reference concrete contract addresses (0x4027d91e..., 0xdF710790..., 0x46f21C3D...) in implementation code (migrations/*.js, batchs/*.js, site/app.js). Some of these addresses are explicitly annotated as BSC mainnet in comments in implementation files (site/app.js).
- truffle-config.js also contains BscScan api_keys and the truffle verify plugin, indicating intended verification on BscScan from implementation config.

Per the project’s CRITICAL REQUIREMENT, this is concrete evidence in implementation code (not README/docs/comments only). The truffle configuration plus migration and batch scripts that call artifacts.require(...).at(<0x...>) with BSC RPC and BSC network id constitute valid implementation-level evidence that contracts were deployed and/or targeted on BSC mainnet.

Detailed Findings (high level):

- truffle-config.js explicitly configures a 'bsc' network with network_id: 56 and provider pointing to https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (BSC mainnet RPC).
- migrations/1_initial_migration.js (implementation) attempts to attach to ColToken at 0x4027d91e... (address present in code) and contains logic to upgrade/deploy depending on existing instance.
- migrations/2_nft_migration.js.disable contains conditional mapping: if (network == ""bsc"") contractAddress = ""0xdF710790..."" and uses upgradeProxy/ deployProxy; that is a BSC-targeted migration mapping within implementation code.
- Multiple batch scripts (batchs/*.js) instantiate artifacts.require('ColToken' or 'ColNft').at(<0x...>) using the same addresses and then call contract methods (distribute, give, mintGenesisBoxes, setApprovalForAll), demonstrating actual on-chain calls targeting those addresses.
- site/app.js uses web3 and sets tokenContractAddress = ""0x4027d91e..."" with a comment ""// bsc Main Net"" and also uses a BSC testnet RPC for loading contract info (https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545). These are implementation-file JS usages interacting with BSC endpoints and addresses.

Evidence is present in Solidity deployment scripts and in the Foundry configuration (implementation files), not only in README or comments. Key points:

- scripts/Deploy.s.sol contains a DeployBNB contract that uses BNBScript and calls a deployment helper with AaveV3BNB.* constants (POOL, DEFAULT_INCENTIVES_CONTROLLER), demonstrating an actual deploy path for the BNB network in code.
- scripts/DeployUpgrade.s.sol contains a DeployBNB contract and a deployBNB() helper that wires the AaveV3BNB constants for upgrade payloads.
- foundry.toml includes an etherscan configuration entry for the 'bnb' network with chainId = 56 and an rpc_endpoints entry for bnb, which are concrete configuration settings in an implementation/config file.
- tests/Upgrade.t.sol includes an UpgradeBNBTest that calls DeployUpgrade.deployBNB(), showing tests/scripts exercise the BNB deployment path in code.
